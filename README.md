Hardhat to interact with the contracts
OpenZeppelin to import useful Contracts
Reactjs and React Bootstrap for Front-end stuff

<!-- ## Working with the repo on your system

Clone the repo into your code editor and run
```shell
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies required for project to function.
Then initialize hardhat and compile to create artifacts

```shell
npx hardhat
npx hardhat compile
```

Once the contract gets compiled, go ahead and copy the NFT ABI from artifacts/contracts/NFT.sol/NFT.json into src/abi/NFTabi.js and default export it.
Do the same for NFTMarket contract as well
